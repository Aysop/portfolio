            <p1>When I consider "who I am", I take three things into account: where I came from, where I am, and where I'm going. Geographically, I'm from rural Ohio, of which I have little to comment on. Currently, I'm a server in Naples, FL, navigating my way to a Software Engineering degree. Personally, I find this "where I am currently" to be the most important, for it dictates "where I'm going"- And where I want to be, is among the stars. <br><br> I speak in hypotheticals, of course, and a more realistic answer would be "an excelling member of my field". I have quite a ways to go, but I believe if I continue on the trjectory I've set for myself, I'll find myself just where I'd like to be.<br><br>As for interests, gaming has always been a landmark in my life. I grew up in the age of N64's and Playstations and dedicated a sizable portion of my life playing them with my sibilings and trying to understand them. As we grew older, our shared passion of gaming evolved, and strengthens our bonds to this day. In fact, the only way I can consistently keep in touch with a few of them, is when were grinding in-game! It's reasons like these, among innumerable others, I hope to one day transform my hobby into something of a career, and beyond that, a passion.<br><br>
